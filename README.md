# Quadratic Equations Solver

Solve roots of Quadratic Equations.

# How to Use

1. Open quadratic_equation.py
2. Change arguments in func get_roots(a, b, c). By default (1, 1, 1)
3. Save file
4. Launch quadratic_equation.py with Python3

In terminal: 
<pre>
    <code>
    python3 quadratic_equation.py
    </code>
</pre>



# How to Launch Tests

<pre>
    <code>
    python3 tests.py
    </code>
</pre>

If success: 
<pre>
    <code>
    Ran 4 tests in 0.001s
    OK
    </code>
</pre>



# Project Goals
